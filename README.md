# Java_Course_Project
Hi there! This is my Java Course Project.\
Here is an instruction how to run my application:
1. Download code as a .zip from my GitHub repo or clone it directly from your IDE.
2. After successful extraction, open the code folder with your favourite IDE.
3. Here you have to find a ParkingApplication java class - that`s the entry point of an application.
4. Right click on ParkingApplication java class --> "Run 'ParkingApplication' ".
5. You have to open a Postman to check the GET/PUT/POST/DELETE methods.
6. Ensure that my app is insanely good (it's a lie)
